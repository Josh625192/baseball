    <h2>What is Baseball</h2>
    <h3>History of Baseball</h3>
    <p>Baseball is a game that was created a long time ago. It is a game that has stood the test of time and has truly thrived in whatever situation they might be brought to. Baseball is known as America’s Pasttime for a reason. The story behind that name is as follows: Since the early twentieth century, baseball has been considered “America’s Pastime.” It has been the sport that defines America the most, playing a massive role in America’s culture overall. Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States.</p>
    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>Baseball is a game for all. The game dates back as far as 1744, and the rules of baseball are pretty much the same today. The rules are as follows: a game is played between two teams, each consisting of 9 players, one team bats while the other fields and the match consists of 9 innings, and each team bats once in every inning, in the end, the team with most runs wins the game and there are no draws, if after 9 innings, both teams have scored the same number of runs, an extra innings is included in the game, the fielding team has designated spots for fielders, a pitcher and a catcher, first baseman and second baseman, shortstop, third baseman and three outfielder stand in left, center and right field, if the team batting second in the 9th inning is ahead in runs, they do not have to bat in the ninth inning, each team gets three outs per inning while batting and then the other team gets the chance to bat, and finally the visiting team bats first while the hosting team bats second and they continue to flip flop until the game is over.</p>
